📝 PROJECT SCOPE: User Stories for PricePro

As a Buyer/Seller:

-> As a User, I want to **input specific property details** (area, size, age, number of amenities nearby), so I can get an accurate price prediction.
-> As a User, I want the system to **clearly explain the factors** (perks) that significantly influenced the predicted price, so I can understand the valuation.
-> As a User, I want to **view historical price trends** for a specific area, so I can gauge market stability.

As an Investor:

-> As an Investor, I want to **set investment goals** (e.g., 20% return in 5 years), so the system can filter and suggest areas accordingly.
-> As an Investor, I want the system to **suggest high-potential investment areas**, predicting the future profitable value based on ML trends.
-> As an Investor, I want to **view risk scores** associated with each suggested area, so I can make informed decisions.

As a Developer:

-> As a Developer, I want a clear **ML training pipeline** (`model/model_pipeline.py`), so I can easily update and retrain the prediction model.
-> As a Developer, I want the API to clearly **separate prediction logic** from web routing, so the system is scalable.
